# 🦁 Zoo Biological Longevity & Conservation Analysis

A specialized Python data engineering project that analyzes taxonomic longevity and sexual dimorphism across 300+ species. This tool automates the generation of a 'Biological Longevity & Conservation Report' using advanced pandas data manipulation.

## 📊 Key Research Findings (The Story)
* **Taxonomic Hierarchy:** Mammals lead with the highest average lifespan (14.71y), followed by Aves (12.20y) and Reptilia (11.63y).
* **Longevity Giants:** Identified the "Andean Condor" and "Asian Elephant" as the global longevity leaders, reaching lifespans of 42-47 years.
* **Sexual Dimorphism Trends:** Discovered significant 'Sex Gaps' in longevity—notably, African Elephant females significantly outlive males by nearly 14 years.
* **Data Reliability:** Implemented a reliability scoring system, identifying that 96% of the studied species have "High" scientific data integrity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering
* **Core Engine:** Python 3.x
* **Data Science Library:** Pandas (Used for data initialization, type conversion, and aggregation).
* **Feature Engineering:** Implemented Longevity Tiers, Gender Gap calculations, and Super-Ager identification.
* **Automation:** Automated file I/O for scientific report generation (`report.txt`).

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Automated Data Cleaning:** Standardizes column names and handles missing scientific values.
* **Taxonomic Filtering:** Focused analysis on Mammalia, Reptilia, and Aves.
* **Research Advisory:** A built-in module to identify species with a high 'Uncertainty Window' needing further research.
